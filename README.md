* Daemonized the listener thread
* All downloads will take place in the current directory of the application while the uploads are saved in the collab directory
* Integration of hash function
* Made a dictionary of files stored in the current node
* Upload and download amounts now currently reflect what actually happens
* Made the sleep function simpler
* Added more comments to the constructor and the import section
* Downloads now take place in separate folders
* Updated README files with individual responsibilities
* Added a shell script which will delete all folders created due to the system

### How to run Collab
* Run the following command for each node
* `python collab.py port_number`
